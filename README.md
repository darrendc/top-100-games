Welcome to my first CLI application!
This application scrapes IGN's list of the top 50 greatestest games of all times and returns the game's rating and developer.

The application first displays an introduction.

the first prompt asks the user to input a letter.
The letter input generates a numbered list of games on IGN's list that match the first letter of the game's title.

The second prompt asks the user to input a number.
The number input corresponds to the previously generated list of games. The chosen game's rank and developer is returned.

after 3 seconds the application loops back to the start.

Type "exit" at any input stage to leave the application.
