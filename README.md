Welcome to my first CLI application!
This application scrape's IGN's list of the top 50 greatestest games of all times and returns the game's rating and developer.

The application first provides an introduction to the application.

the first prompt asks the user to input a letter.
The letter input generates a numbered list of games on IGN's list that match the first letter of the game's title.

The second prompt asks the user to input a number.
The user's number corresponds to the previously generated list of games. The chosen game's rating and develop is returned.
